Built a definition for probabilities and analysed its precision over a range of draws and trials. Also, in the course of this, i learned how to use mplot3d.

It seems that somewhat of an equilibrium has set over the last couple of days: I am reading and watching the course content of 'python for everybody', while doing the respective exercises. The exercises are the actual coding work in my learning experience so far. I implemented a distinct folder for the exercises which, up until this point in time, differentiate into exercises attained from the py4e and the QuantEcon python courses. This differentiation is representated by distinction of two subfolders containing the resprective sets of exercises. All going well! Fun, interesting doable challenges along the way till now :)
